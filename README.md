# Regular Expression Predictive Search Bar

---

## Lessons Learned:

### CSS:

- Learned how to target the border of an input field when it is focused on using the ".search" selector; this allowed me to change the color of the border when a user is about to type in an input
- Learned how to select the placeholder text within an input field using the pseudo class of "::placeholder"- this allowed me to reposition the text and make the input look more balanced

### JavaScript:

- First time using the RegExp object; I used this in order to utilize regular expressions when trying to search for a city or state using an input field as an entry point
- First time using a GitHub page as an endpoint to find entry data. The only other time I have really utilized something like this in a personal project was the Rick and Morty API with the API endpoint being my source of information.
